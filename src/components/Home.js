      A calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily.
      For example, most calculators will add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Some also do
      square roots, and more complex calculators
      can help with calculus and draw function graphs.
      Calculators are found everywhere.
      In previous projects, you created the core
      functionality of the app: a calculator component.
      Now you should develop a full website with several pages
